👋 Hello, World! I’m Hasna  👋

As a Chemical Engineer with a passion for data, I’ve embarked on an exciting journey that bridges the gap between the physical world of manufacturing and the digital realm of data analysis. Let me tell you a bit about my story:

🧪 Chemical Engineer Turned Data Enthusiast 📊

Background: I hold a degree in Chemical Engineering, which has equipped me with a solid foundation in process optimization, quality control, and safety protocols within the manufacturing industry.
Manufacturing Experience: I’ve spent valuable years working in manufacturing plants, where I’ve optimized processes, analyzed sensor data, and collaborated with plant maintenance teams. From troubleshooting production lines to ensuring efficient resource utilization, I’ve witnessed firsthand the intricate dance of chemicals and machinery.
Breaking into Data: Curiosity led me beyond the pipes and reactors. I realized that the vast amounts of data generated in modern plants held untapped potential. So, I rolled up my sleeves, learned Python, SQL, and data visualization tools, and dove headfirst into the world of data analysis.

📈 Data Science: My New Playground 🌐

Data Exploration: I now explore datasets like a detective, seeking patterns, anomalies, and hidden insights. Whether it’s financial data, productivity metrics, or sensor readings, I’m on the hunt for meaningful correlations.
Machine Learning: I’ve delved into statistical models, machine learning algorithms, and predictive analytics. From regression to neural networks, I’m fascinated by how data-driven decisions can transform processes.
Visualization Wizardry: Creating compelling visualizations is my superpower. I turn raw data into beautiful charts, graphs, and dashboards that tell compelling stories.
